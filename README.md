# Indonesia landmark Memory Game - Project 2

## Motivation
This project requires us to use Vue, MongoDB and Axios to create an interactive game backed by a RESTful API. 
The project is a memory game for travel enthusiasts or those who are keen in learning more about Indonesia’s landmarks and culture. 
This is a suggestion for the Indonesiam Tourism Board, as a method to further enhance their promotion. 
It aims to attract travellers furthermore increasing Indonesia's tourism flow and driving more traffic to their [official website](https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/home).

Site owner’s goal: Attract the target audience (travel enthusiasts aka tourists) to play 
the game and lead them to visit the official tourism website in hopes they would plan and book a holiday. 

External user’s goal: The target audience are seeking for ideas on where to go for their next holiday and come across the game, 
which they become interested in learning more about the available attractions to visit in Indonesia and go to the tourism board web to book.
